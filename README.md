# JBI-19-505 - Little evidence of range size conservatism in freshwater plants across two continents

This repository contain all the code and data for the reproducibility of the results obtained.

# Data

The data can be found in `...`. It consists of shape files for the territory the aquatic species occupy in Europe and North America.

# Code

All code was written in `python`. 

# Figures

The disposition of panels in some of the final figures are different as the ones found within the `jupyter notebooks`. This is because their disposition within the figure was edited with the software `inkscape`. 

# Authorship

All code was written by me.
